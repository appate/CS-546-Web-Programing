	<h1>The Day I Adopted a Stray Dog</h1>
	<main>
		<p>It was a beautiful summer day and I was taking a walk in the park when I saw her. A small, scrappy-looking dog with matted fur and big, pleading eyes.</p>
		<p>She was wagging her tail and looking up at me, and I could tell that she was looking for a friend. I reached out to pet her and she licked my hand, as if to say "thank you for noticing me".</p>
		<p>I knew I couldn't leave her there. She was clearly a stray and needed a loving home. So, I scooped her up and took her with me.</p>
		<p>At first, I wasn't sure how my other pets would react to her. I already had two cats and a dog, and I didn't want them to feel jealous or threatened.</p>
		<p>But, to my surprise, they welcomed her with open paws. The cats even let her curl up with them on the couch, and my dog showed her around the yard.</p>
		<p>It took some time and patience, but eventually she started to trust me. She would snuggle up next to me on the couch and give me kisses, as if to say "I'm so happy to be here".</p>
		<p>Now, years later, she's still with me. She's not the scrappy-looking dog I found in the park anymore - she's a beloved member of our family, with a shiny coat and a wagging tail.</p>
		<p>People often ask me how I knew she was the one. And I always say, it was her eyes. They were big and pleading, and they told me everything I needed to know - that she needed a friend, and I was that friend.</p>
